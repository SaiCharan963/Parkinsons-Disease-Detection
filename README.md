# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting Parkinson's disease (PD) from voice recordings. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The model utilizes various machine learning algorithms and feature extraction techniques to analyze voice recordings from individuals with and without PD. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes voice recordings from individuals with PD and healthy controls. The proposed model achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting PD, making it a promising tool for early PD detection. The development of such a model can potentially improve clinical diagnosis and help individuals with PD receive earlier treatment.


Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a progressive disease that causes tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement, speech, and cognitive function. Early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can help improve the quality of life for patients by enabling timely interventions and treatment.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence that has shown tremendous potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and prediction. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been developed to analyze large datasets of patient information and clinical data to detect early signs of Parkinson's disease. These algorithms can help physicians identify patients at risk for Parkinson's disease and provide early interventions to slow disease progression.

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect Parkinson's disease using dataset We will use a large dataset of patient information, including vocal frequencies, to train our machine learning model. The model will be trained using Support Vector Machine Model, Perceptron, Decision Tree. And will be tested to achieve high accuracy and sensitivity in Parkinson's disease detection.

Our project has the potential to revolutionize Parkinson's disease diagnosis by providing an accurate, non-invasive, and cost-effective method for early detection. We hope that our research will lead to the development of new clinical tools that can be used by healthcare providers to improve the quality of life for Parkinson's disease patients.
